### A simple font library that supports 64x64 monospace fonts for the Playstation 2

I wasn't happy with the fixed XYOFFSET and the inefficiency of the FONTX library in the PS2SDK. And well, I don't like abstracting the GS away with gsKit.

For an example of usage, check the sample folder, there are some very important comments in there (regarding framebuffer modes in particular)

This library was developed initially for my other project [biosdrain](https://github.com/f0bes/biosdrain), another example of how to use this

I'll happy fix and improve this library if issues are raised, or if I decide to work on it, colour is a trivial addition I would be able to add.
